# isomorphic-github-demo

> Isomorphic github demo using Alt Flux and react-router

## Running This

Run, one after the other:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Then open your browser to `localhost:8000`.

In the main search box you can enter either a github user name (ie: `satyam`) and press the `[user]` button
or a full repository name (ie: `satyam/malt`) and press `[repository]`

While you navigate the application within the client, the server will only receive data requests,
which it will forward to the GitHub API.

You can also request any of the URLs generated by the application and the page will be generated server-side

The formatting is not particularly fancy (actually, it is horrible) and the data is scant,
it is only meant to show how to handle isomorphism.
